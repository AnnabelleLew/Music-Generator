# Music-Generator
This uses spectrograms to create randomly generated music!

# How to use
1) Use songs_to_arrays() to convert all of the songs in a directory into a list of spectrograms.
2) Use generate_array() to create a random spectrogram based off of the songs in the directory.
3) Use arrays_to_songs() to convert the random spectrogram back into a .wav file.

Volume warning for all songs!
